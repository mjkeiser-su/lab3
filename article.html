					A Front End Web Developer Is Aware
				</h2>

				<div class="article-body">
					<p>
						One idea that has lodged itself into my brain recently
						(largely from
						<a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/193-the-state-of-front-end-dev-ala-rebroadcast/">this panel discussion</a>) is how a front end developer needs to be
						<em>aware</em>. In a general sense, the front end
						developer is positioned in the middle of lots of other
						jobs. Everybody involved in a web team ends up talking
						with the front end developers. That makes sense. The
						front end developers create
						<em>the actual thing</em> people interact with.
						Everything comes together with the front end developer.
						Perhaps that's why it's such a fun job!
					</p>

					<p>
						Because the front end developer is this central hub
						position and dealing with lots of different people doing
						lots of different jobs, the job can be
						<em>done better</em> if they are <em>aware</em>. Aware
						of everything else that makes a website tick.

							example of what you can do with just a few things, a
							little imagination and a happy dream in your heart.
							We'll paint one happy little tree right here.

					<p class="aware">
						A front end developer is aware of design.<br />
						If they aren't a designer themselves, they know how
						important design is. They have good taste in design.
						They know about the tools involved. They know where the
						design role fits into the process.
					</p>

					<p class="aware">
						A front end developer is aware of the back end.<br />
						If they aren't a back end coder themselves, they know
						how important the back end is. They know what the back
						end is capable of delivering and what it isn't. They
						know the responsibilities back end developers have. They
						know the languages involved. They know how to ask for
						what they need on the front end.
					</p>

					<p class="aware">
						A front end developer is aware of the network.<br />
						They know that websites are delivered over the internet,
						a network, and that that network is a wild and sometimes
						unpredictable place. They know networks can be on or
						off, fast or slow, and reliable or unreliable.
					</p>

					<p class="aware">
						A front end developer is aware of performance.<br />
						If they aren't entirely performance focused themselves,
						they know that performance is vital to a website's
						success. They know performance is a complex world onto
						itself. They know there are quick wins and long term
						struggles. They know that so long as the back end is
						fast, the other 80% of the time a website is loading is
						a front end concern.
					</p>

					<p class="aware">
						A front end developer is aware of content strategy.<br />
						If they aren't a content strategist themselves, they
						know that websites live and die by the content on them.
						They know that the lack of a content plan can cause
						problems that you may not be able to develop your way
						out of. They know that the people that use the website
						is what matters and those people need to find what they
						need and expect it to be in good shape.
					</p>

					<p class="aware">
						A front end developer is aware of databases.<br />
						The content lives there. The content must be in good
						shape. The front end developer can only work with what
						comes out of those databases. The front end developer
						needs to combine what comes out of those databases with
						templates to make the website happen.
					</p>

					<p class="aware">
						A front end developer is aware of testing.<br />
						So many kinds! Integration testing. Regression testing.
						User testing!
					</p>

					<p class="aware">
						A front end developer is aware of systems.<br />
						They might be responsible for implementing a design
						system, or an icon system, or a coding style guide. They
						might have to create those systems themselves. They
						might need to document those systems.
					</p>

					<p class="aware">
						A front end developer is aware of devops.<br />
						They are writing and committing code along with every
						other coder on the project, so they need to adhere to
						the same setup as everyone else. If they didn't write
						the build system themselves, they know what it is, what
						it does, and what it is capable of. If they didn't set
						up deployment themselves, they know how to use it.
					</p>

					<p class="aware">
						A front end developer is aware of servers.<br />
						Without them, there is no website.
					</p>

					<p class="aware">
						A front end developer is aware of accessibility.<br />
						If they aren't well versed in building for accessibility
						themselves, they know that it's important. They know how
						to test for it. They know who to talk to about it. They
						know there is quick wins and long term struggles
						regarding it.
					</p>

					<p class="aware">
						A front end developer is aware of the device
						landscape.<br />
						They know the web is everywhere these days and a good
						website needs to meet users there. Big screens, little
						screens, touch screens, far away screens, black and
						white screens. The front end developer is aware of the
						unknown.
					</p>

							enjoy it. Let it make you happy. A fan brush is a
							fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends
							with it. Let your heart be your guide. Let's put
							some happy little clouds in our world.

						That's just a handful of the things a great front end
						developer should be aware of. The more the better.
					</p>

					<p>
						All this, of course, on top of their own direct job.
						HTML, CSS, JavaScript, responsive design, libraries and
						frameworks, communication... this list is scary-long
						itself!
