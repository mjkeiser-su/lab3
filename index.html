					</h2>
					<p class="post-teaser">
						One idea that has lodged itself into my brain recently
						(largely from this panel discussion) is how a front end
						developer needs to be aware. In a general sense, the
						front end developer is positioned in the middle of lots
						of other jobs...

					<p class="post-teaser">
						I strongly believe that the documentation should be kept
						as close to the code as possible. Based on my
						experience, that's the only option that works well in

						baseline for understanding how it works.…
